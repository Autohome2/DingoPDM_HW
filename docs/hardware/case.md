# Case

The mechanical design is centered around simple designs that can be created in a home shop. 

* 3D Printed Case
* Flat aluminum heatsink plate
* Flat aluminum baseplate
* The heatsink is designed to be 2 pieces. A heatsink plate and a baseplate
    * The heatsink plate provides clearance for the THT pins of the Deutsch connectors and the RedCube terminal while getting as close to the Profets as possible
    * !!! warning
        The heatsink plate should be covered on both sides with a thermal pad material to electricaly isolate the heatsink while still providing a thermal interface (Example: 3M 5583S)
    * The baseplate holds the case and also sandwiches the spacer plate to the PCB
