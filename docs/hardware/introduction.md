# Hardware Introduction

## KiCad

## Open Items

* Test V7.1 thermal performance

## Design Notes

* Prior to V6, the design had a lot of features which meant a lot of parts
* To make the board cheaper, easier to source/produce and quicker to test the design was drastically simplified
* The Deutsch DT connector was selected due to it's popularity, part availability and ease of use
* BTS724 was used on V6, but removed for V7 due to thermal issues. It wouldn't trip until a very high current.
