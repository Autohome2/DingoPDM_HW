## Goals

* Learn more about PDMs and high DC current devices
* Learn about developing firmware for a more complex STM32 based project
* Create a low cost device that my friends and I can use in our project cars
* Layout the board to fit simple case designs
    * 3D printed top shell and flat aluminum heatsinks (no machining)
* Use low cost 1oz/0.5oz 4 layer PCBs (low cost 2oz/1oz now available from JLCPCB)
* Share my work with others for reference, inspiration or collaboration. 

If this project does help you in any way, I'd appreciate a message!
